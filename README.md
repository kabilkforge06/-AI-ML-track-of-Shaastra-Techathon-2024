# üö¶ AI/ML Challenge - Shaastra Techathon 2024
üö¶ This project is a cutting-edge solution developed for Shaastra Techathon 2024, hosted by IIT Madras. It leverages Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision techniques to automate traffic violation detection using CCTV feeds in real-time.

## üìú Certificate of Participation

I participated in the **AI/ML challenge track** at **Shaastra Techathon 2024**, organized by **IIT Madras**, where I explored real-world problem solving using AI technologies. This repository serves as a reflection of my journey, learning, and experimentation during the hackathon.

## üéØ Challenge Theme

**Smart Traffic Violation Detection System**

> Design an AI-based system that can detect traffic violations like signal jumping, wrong-way driving, and lane-crossing using CCTV footage.

## üß† My Role & Learning Outcome

During the challenge, I:

- Explored the use of **YOLOv8** for real-time object detection.
- Experimented with **OpenCV** to process video frames from CCTV footage.
- Studied **license plate detection** using OCR (EasyOCR).
- Understood how to build a basic **AI pipeline** for surveillance systems.
- Learned how to structure a real-world AI/ML project under time constraints.

Even though this was not a final product submission, I gained valuable experience working with computer vision tools and frameworks. I also collaborated with mentors and peers to understand practical use cases of AI.

Grateful to mentors and volunteers for insights and support.

## üß™ Project Experiments (Prototype Code)

```python
import cv2
import easyocr
import torch

# Load a pre-trained YOLOv8 model
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')  # Placeholder for yolov8

# Read video
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('sample_video.mp4')

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Inference
    results = model(frame)

    # Display
    results.render()
    cv2.imshow('YOLOv5 Inference', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
